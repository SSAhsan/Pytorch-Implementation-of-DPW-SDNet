Pytorch Implementation of the Paper "DPW-SDNet: Dual Pixel-Wavelet Domain Deep CNNs for Soft Decoding of JPEG-Compressed Images"
Pytorch implementation of the paper, "DPW-SDNet: Dual Pixel-Wavelet Domain Deep CNNs for Soft Decoding of JPEG-Compressed Images". This repo contains the Jupyter notebook for training DPW-SDNet (https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10558).
This code is written for grayscale JPEG image deblocking. It can easily be modified to train RGB images by changing the input channels and final output channels to 3. This following repo helped a lot to write functions for the jupyter notebook. 
Do check it out at https://github.com/cszn/KAIR/tree/master! The performance of this implementation is very close to the reported values in the paper.
